# Project Summary

This project is something I've wanted to do for a while, so this was a great opportunity to work on it. I've always enjoyed solving crossword puzzles, and I thought it would be fun to create a web app that allows users to create and share crossword puzzles. Users can create a crossword puzzle by entering a list of words and their corresponding clues. The app will then generate a crossword puzzle grid with the words placed in the grid. Users can also solve crossword puzzles created by other users. The app will check the user's answers and provide feedback on whether the answers are correct or not. Users can also share their crossword puzzles with others by sharing a link to the puzzle. I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I'm happy with how it turned out.

# Features

-   Allows users to create crossword puzzles by entering a list of words and their corresponding clues.
-   Frontend is built using React and TailwindCSS, using React Context for state management.

-   Used MongoDB for the database to store crossword puzzles that users can access and solve.
